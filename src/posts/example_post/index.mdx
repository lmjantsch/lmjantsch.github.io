import { Counter, Note } from './components'

export const metadata = {
  version: '1.0.0',
  reviewDate: '2026-10-26'
};

This post demonstrates the full power of MDX. The current date is {new Date().toLocaleDateString()}.
We've also exported a `metadata` object from this file, which you can see has a version of **{metadata.version}**.

## Basic Markdown Elements

This section covers the fundamentals. You can have **bold text**, *italic text*, and ~~strikethrough text~~. You can also combine them, like ***this***. Don't forget `inline code snippets`.

This is a link to the [official MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).

> Blockquotes are perfect for highlighting quotes or important notes. They can span multiple lines and contain other formatting elements like **bold** text.

## Advanced Markdown: Tables and More

Tables are essential for displaying structured data.

| Header 1      | Header 2      | Header 3 |
|---------------|:-------------:|----------|
| Cell 1, Col 1 | Centered Text | 123      |
| Cell 2, Col 1 | More Text     | 456      |
| Cell 3, Col 1 | And More...   | 789      |

Here is a footnote[^1]. And another one[^longnote].

[^1]: This is the footnote text.
[^longnote]: Footnotes can also be longer and contain multiple lines of text.

You can also include images:

*A caption for the image above.*

## Code Blocks Showcase

This is where MDX truly shines. You can embed interactive React components directly into your Markdown.

### Counter Component

<Counter client:load/>

### Note Component

You can create styled callouts or notes to draw attention to specific content.

<Note>
  This is an **info** note. You can pass *Markdown* directly as children to a React component!
</Note>

<Note type="warning">
  This is a **warning** note. Be careful with this feature, as it can be powerful but also complex.
</Note>

## Using Raw HTML

Sometimes you just need to drop down to raw HTML. The `<details>` element is a great example.

<details>
  <summary>Click to expand for more details</summary>
  <p>
    This content is hidden by default. It's useful for FAQs or supplementary information that shouldn't clutter the main content. You can put any HTML or Markdown content in here.
  </p>
</details>

## Embedded Content

You can easily embed content from other sources using iframes.

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingBottom: '56.25%', height: 0, overflow: 'hidden', maxWidth: '100%', background: '#000', margin: '2em 0' }}>
  <iframe
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ"
    style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}
    frameBorder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowFullScreen
    title="Embedded YouTube video"
  ></iframe>
</div>
