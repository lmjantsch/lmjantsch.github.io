This is an example blog post that demonstrates the various elements you can use and how they are styled by `@tailwindcss/typography`.

## Section 1: Basic Formatting

You can write text and it will be formatted in paragraphs. You can also make text **bold** or *italic*. Here's a link to the [Astro documentation](https://docs.astro.build/).

Blockquotes are a great way to call out important information:
> The future of web development is fast, content-focused, and component-driven. Astro is designed to deliver on that vision.

## Section 2: Lists and Code

Organizing content is easy with lists.

### Unordered List
- Item 1: The first point.
- Item 2: Another important thought.
  - Sub-item 2.1: A nested detail.
- Item 3: The final conclusion.

### Ordered List
1. First, install the necessary dependencies.
2. Second, configure your files.
3. Finally, deploy your application.

Code is a crucial part of any technical blog. You can have `inline code` snippets, or larger, syntax-highlighted code blocks.

```javascript
// Example of a well-formatted JavaScript code block
import { defineCollection, z } from 'astro:content';

const post = defineCollection({
	schema: () => z.object({
		title: z.string(),
		description: z.string(),
		date: z.coerce.date(),
	}),
});

export const collections = { post };
